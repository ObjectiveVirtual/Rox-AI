 # What is Rox ?
Rox is an offline AI chatbot programmed to assist you with various tasks like evaluate and calculate expressions or simply answer questions.
Rox is based on our open source project : **The OGPTC Project**.![Rox AI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9136e70d-77d7-4ba0-bf64-59478a1b8612)


You cannot contribute to the developpement of this software, but you can make your own using our **open source project**!


 # Why should I use Rox ?
Because Rox is incredibly good at answering questions especially when you are **offline**.

 # What are the risks involved ?
Rox is still under developpement, and as it is offline, we must create a complete local database _(Wich make us somehow lazy)_ to make it able to answer to any request.

Wich means it cannot do litterally **everything**!

 # Who made Rox ?
Rox is created by Objective:Virtual, a group of developpers who are intersted in **computer science**, espicially in AI developpement.


 # Is it safe to use ?
Of course, Rox isn't a virus/malware since it is based on an open source project, it is not a bloatware, and not that annoying! But **keep in mind it only works for PCs under Windows!**

# How do I install it ?
Well, for the first releases it is quiet easy (v.1.0 - v.1.0.2), you just go to releases, and you download the .zip file, once extracted you open the .exe installer and follow the instructions on the screen.

For newer versions (such as v.1.0.3 - Latest), you will have to setup everything for yourself (_yeah, we're really sorry!_), start by going to releases, then download the .zip file and then extract the .iso file, then mount the ISO, copy all the content from your ISO disc and paste them somewhere in your C: drive (We recommend you to create a folder in C: and call it whatever you want then pasting inside of it the content), once done you will have to create a shortcut to your desktop, right click the file called "winroxai.exe" and select send to desktop option. On your desktop select the created shortcut and rename it by "Rox AI". Now you're all set! Enjoy our App !

# Installation Steps:
To make the installation guide more easier to understand, we made a list of steps that you must follow in order to properly install the Chatbot:

  **2- After download, extract the .zip file to your desktop**

  **5- Go back to the .iso, copy and paste the content to the created folder**
